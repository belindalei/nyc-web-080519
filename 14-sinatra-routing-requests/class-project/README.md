# Sinatra REST & Advanced Requests

# Questions:

- instance variables in controller
- debugging
- routes vs erb files

## Purpose of today's lecture

    - Thus far we have worked on a Sinatra app but we've only handled simple GET requests.
    - Today we will discuss the other HTTP methods
        - How do our users send other requests to our server?

## Goal for today's lecture

    - Add a second model to our application
    - Add full CRUD functionality for our models


## Activity

- Create the index and show routes for Carnival
- User should be able to click on a carnival's name on the index page to be sent to the show page


- Controller
    - create my routes
    - Tell my controller what to do when it finds a match for a route

- Views
    - create the respones for when my controller finds a match 


CRUD - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
