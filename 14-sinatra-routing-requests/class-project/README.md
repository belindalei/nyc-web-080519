# Sinatra REST & Advanced Requests

## Purpose of today's lecture

- Thus far we have worked on a Sinatra app but we've only handled simple GET requests.
- Today we will discuss the other HTTP methods
- How do our users send other requests to our server?

## Goal for today's lecture

- Add a second model to our application
- Add full CRUD functionality for our models
