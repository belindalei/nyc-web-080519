# React

- JSX
    - syntactical sugar that allows us to write "html" in Javascript 
- Virtual DOM (not specific to React)
    - Allows Declaritive programming
    - Run more efficiently
- Components (class vs function)
    - functions that return JSX
    - reusable
- Props
    - information passed to a component
    - an argument for the function
    - purpose is to change the behavior of that function
        - the "thing" that this function returns should be different if the argument is different
    - props come from the "Parent" component
